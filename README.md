midterm works 


My work is a is a test model of the my final project.

there're 2 sensors on this arduino works, an IR sensor and  a presssure sensor. 

My arduino  is connected with the computer, when I touch the pressure sensor, you can see a small led lights,
and the value of pressure will be shown  in the processing screen.

About the IR sensor's part, you can use a  remote control to send a message to the arduino board and control the rgb jumbo. 
Buttons of the remote control are represented the color of the rgb jumbo.
There are red, blue, green, purple, arquamarine and orange colors, and if you click #, you can turn off the led.
